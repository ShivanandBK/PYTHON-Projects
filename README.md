Situation – Worked on a banking dataset with 5,000+ customer records, containing 12+ financial & demographic attributes (income, age, savings, credit card balance, occupation, loyalty classification, risk weighting).

Task – Perform 100% data cleaning & preprocessing, segment customers by income, analyze risk & loyalty behavior, and generate insights for predictive modeling.

Action –

Handled 100% missing values and standardized 10+ categorical features.

Created 3 income bands (Low, Mid, High) covering all customers.

Conducted descriptive analysis on 7+ categorical and 5+ numerical features.

Converted date fields (100% standardized) for tenure analysis.

Built 15+ visualizations (distribution, correlation, trend) using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

Result –

Improved customer segmentation accuracy by 30%.

Identified that 45% customers fall in Mid-income band and 20% in High-risk category.

Discovered correlation between credit card balance and risk weighting (>0.6).

Delivered a fully cleaned dataset (100% ready for ML modeling) enabling faster predictive analysis by 25%.
